Post-Apocalyptic Communication System

This is a client-server communication system with messages encrypted with RSA-SHA1. Like normal encrypted systems, it uses a public key to enable a handshake between the two users. The messages are first converted to base-64. This encrypted message is again encyrpted using the user's private key. For further security, it is hashed with a hash function. SHA1 hash standard is used for this project. This encrypted message is send to a the server ip and port. 

The server listens to all clients connected to its ip and port. Whenever a new client is connected to the server, it broadcast the name of the client to all other connected clients.
